# InfrastructureSystems.jl (IS) — IS4 branch

**Package role:** Utility foundation library — Layer 0 of the psy6 stack.
**Julia compat:** ^1.10. Version stays 3.6.0 until release (this *is* the 4.0 line; never bump — bumps have reappeared spontaneously mid-session, revert them).

## Overview

Foundational library for performance-critical simulation packages: SystemData, component containers, time series (HDF5/in-memory + SQLite metadata), serialization, struct codegen, and the `RelativeUnits` layer. General Sienna practices: the `sienna-psy6` skill. Workspace wiring: the psy6 workspace root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Downstream blast radius

**Every psy6 package sits on IS**: PowerSystems, PowerNetworkMatrices, PowerFlows, PowerFlowFileParser, InfrastructureOptimizationModels, PowerOperationsModels, PowerSystemCaseBuilder. Any signature/behavior change ripples platform-wide; time-series, serialization, and units changes are the highest-risk classes — extend serialization round-trip tests when touching them. After an IS change, smoke the stack:

```sh
julia --project=<psy6-workspace-root> -e 'using PowerSystems, PowerNetworkMatrices, PowerFlows, PowerOperationsModels, PowerSystemCaseBuilder'
```

(The psy5 line's PowerSimulations/PSID consume the *top-level* IS checkout on `main`, not this one.)

Two consumers now depend on things IS owns *because* they are shared, so a rename here is a rename
there: PowerSystems calls the `*_sienna_archive` trio and `serialize_arrays`/`deserialize_arrays` from
`src/openapi/file_io.jl`, and PowerSystemsInvestmentsPortfolios is the second archive consumer these
were factored out for.

## Source layout — the non-obvious parts

- `src/InfrastructureSystems.jl` — the **only** place exports are allowed (see Export policy).
- `src/serialization.jl` — JSON-based; JSON3/StructTypes were removed in IS4. Per-type
  deserialize methods narrow JSON's loose types back to declared field types — optional
  `DateTime` (`Union{Nothing, Dates.DateTime}`) and `Vector{String}` (JSON arrays parse to
  `Vector{Any}`).
- `src/geographic_supplemental_attribute.jl`, `src/data_source_supplemental_attribute.jl` —
  the two hand-written supplemental attributes (`GeographicInfo`, `DataSource`); neither is
  exported, and both are shared across components create-once/link-many via the association
  store rather than owned by one component.
- `src/sienna_archive.jl` — the **`.sn` archive container**, and only the container (see below).
- `src/generated/` — auto-generated (**never edit**); `src/descriptors/structs.json` is its source.
- `src/Optimization/` — **abstract types only** (~185 lines): container/key abstracts, formulation
  abstracts, construct stages, enums. The concrete results/container machinery was removed in IS4;
  the consumer defining concretes in this line is **InfrastructureOptimizationModels (IOM)**.

## The Sienna archive and the store's two halves

`src/sienna_archive.jl` owns the **`.sn`** container: a directory of files, tar'd and gzip'd into one
file. It lives here rather than in a consumer because nothing about the container is specific to a
`System` — PowerSystems packs a system document plus its time-series sidecars, PowerSystemsInvestments-
Portfolios will pack whatever a portfolio needs, and reimplementing the rules per package is how two
archives end up disagreeing about what `.sn` means.

```julia
is_sienna_archive(path)                            # extension test a reader dispatches on
create_sienna_archive(fill!, path; force = false)  # fill! populates a staging dir; that becomes the archive
extract_sienna_archive(path)                       # -> directory holding the members
```

Three things to know before touching it:

- **`fill!` decides the contents, this file decides nothing about them.** Keep it that way; a member
  list belongs to the package that writes it.
- **The extension is enforced on write** because it is the whole read-side test. An archive named
  otherwise could not be found again, so a non-`.sn` path is a `DataFormatError`, not a warning.
- **`extract_sienna_archive`'s directory outlives the call.** `mktempdir()`'s default
  `cleanup = true` registers it for atexit deletion, which a caller that keeps reading from the
  extracted files needs — a store opened in place out of the archive, say. Do not wrap it in a
  `do` block.

`Tar` and `CodecZlib` are dependencies for this and nothing else.

### Arrays with and without the catalog

An InfraStore artifact is an HDF5 file plus a `.sqlite` catalog, and `serialize` writes both. A writer
whose own document already carries the catalog's association rows does not need the second half:

- `serialize_arrays(store, path)` writes the array half alone. Atomic, unlike `serialize`.
- `deserialize_arrays(path)` opens such an artifact and mints an empty catalog for a document's rows.
- `import_time_series_association_rows!(store_or_data, json)` replays them — the counterpart of
  `import_supplemental_attribute_association_rows!`.

`open_deserialized_infrastore_store` detects a source with no `.sqlite` beside it and mints rather than
copying one that is not there. Such a source is copied out and given a fresh catalog **`read_only` or
not**: there is no catalog to open in place, and minting one into the caller's directory is exactly the
mutation `read_only` exists to prevent.

These wrap `Store::persist_arrays_to` and `Store::open_without_catalog`, which are **unreleased**
(NatLabRockies/infrastore#71). `[compat] InfraStore` is deliberately unbumped until they ship.

## Units Layer (RelativeUnits)

IS provides unit-system *plumbing* only — SU/DU/NU acquire domain meaning in PowerSystems.jl.
IS itself performs no domain conversions; only the plumbing and `convert_cost_coefficient`
math are testable here. IS exports the markers and `RelativeQuantity` only — there is **no
unit-string vocabulary in IS**; that vocabulary lives in `SiennaSchemas/Core/units.json` for
the data pipeline.

```
RelativeUnits submodule (src/relative_units.jl)
  AbstractUnitSystem ⊃ {AbstractRelativeUnit ⊃ {DeviceBaseUnit, SystemBaseUnit}, NaturalUnit}
  const singletons DU, SU, NU
  RelativeQuantity{T<:Number, U<:AbstractRelativeUnit} <: Number  (built via `0.6 * DU`)
  convert_cost_coefficient + 9-method _cost_coeff_ratio dispatch table (+ erroring catch-all)
  traits: _strip_units (domain packages MUST extend for their quantity types), display_units_arg
```

Guard rails (all dispatch-based, erroring `ArgumentError`s):
- Re-tagging a tagged value (`(0.6DU) * SU`) throws — no silent nesting.
- Cross-unit `+`, `-`, `==`, `<`, `<=`, `isless`, `isapprox` throw — convert explicitly first.
- Tagged-vs-untagged `==`/`+`/`-` (`0.6DU == 0.5`) throw.
- `Base.hash` is defined consistently with the cross-payload `==` (Dict/Set safe for same-unit keys).
- Note: `isequal` falls back to the throwing `==`, so *mixed-unit* Dict keys can throw on
  hash collision — define a non-throwing `isequal` if that's ever needed.

`CostCurve{T,U}` / `FuelCurve{T,U}` carry `U <: AbstractUnitSystem` as a type parameter
(replacing the old `power_units::UnitSystem` runtime field). Serialized under the
`"power_units"` key as the marker type name (e.g. `"SystemBaseUnit"`); `_unit_system_instance`
decodes that name back to the singleton. IS4 is a breaking release: the legacy IS3
`UnitSystem` enum is **no longer accepted** anywhere in the cost-curve API — not as a
constructor argument, not as a serialized value-name (`"SYSTEM_BASE"`). Downstream packages
(PowerSystemCaseBuilder, PowerSystems) must pass `SystemBaseUnit()`/`DeviceBaseUnit()`/
`NaturalUnit()` instances. `zero(c)` preserves the unit parameter; `zero(CostCurve)`
(type form) defaults to NU.

### Time series accessors and the multiplier contract

The `get_time_series_array`/`get_time_series_values` accessor family takes
`units::Union{Nothing, AbstractUnitSystem} = default_units(owner)`, forwarded to the
scaling-factor multiplier; IS performs no conversion itself. `default_units(::Any)`
returns `nothing` (IS fallback); domain packages override it per owner type (e.g.
PowerSystems returns `SU` for `Component`s).

As of IS 4.0, `scaling_factor_multiplier` functions may be either **unit-aware**
(define a 2-arg method `(owner, ::AbstractUnitSystem)`) or **unit-agnostic** (define
only `(owner)` — user closures, pre-IS4 multipliers). `_apply_multiplier`
(in `_make_time_array`) resolves the arity per retrieval:
- It probes unit-awareness with `SU` (the 2-arg convention is `(owner, ::AbstractUnitSystem)`),
  using `requested = units === nothing ? SU : units`.
- **Prefers the 2-arg form** whenever the multiplier is unit-aware — including the default
  path, where `units === nothing` still routes a 2-arg-only multiplier through `(owner, SU)`.
- **Falls back to the 1-arg form only when no 2-arg method exists.**
- **Never silently drops units:** a unit-aware multiplier that lacks a method for the
  requested unit system raises an actionable `ArgumentError` rather than degrading to
  `(owner)`.

Do not remove or weaken the `units` kwarg API, the `default_units` trait, or the
no-silent-units-drop guarantee. (The IS/PSY units-gaps plan of 2026-07-04 is executed —
IS commits `a1fa162f` + `abae2e30`; only the full-suite verification gate remains.)

## Time-Varying Cost Curve Type Hierarchy

Static and time-series-backed curves share abstract parents so `CostCurve`/`FuelCurve`
accept either with zero code changes:

```
FunctionData
├─ StaticFunctionData            (scalar data)
│   ├─ LinearFunctionData, QuadraticFunctionData
│   └─ PiecewiseLinearData, PiecewiseStepData
└─ TimeSeriesFunctionData{T<:StaticFunctionData}   (wraps a TimeSeriesKey; data lives in
    the time series store)                          e.g. TimeSeriesFunctionData{PiecewiseStepData}

ValueCurve{T<:FunctionData}
├─ InputOutputCurve / IncrementalCurve / AverageRateCurve          (static)
└─ TimeSeriesInputOutputCurve / TimeSeriesIncrementalCurve /
   TimeSeriesAverageRateCurve   <: ValueCurve{<:TimeSeriesFunctionData}
    (TimeSeriesIncrementalCurve and TimeSeriesAverageRateCurve carry initial_input /
     input_at_zero as Union{Nothing, ConcreteTimeSeriesKey} fields — do NOT "fix" the
     union for boxing)

Cost aliases (cost_aliases.jl): LinearCurve, QuadraticCurve, PiecewisePointCurve,
PiecewiseIncrementalCurve, PiecewiseAverageCurve + TimeSeries* counterparts (all exported).
```

Key interface functions:
- `is_time_series_backed(x)` — uniform static-vs-TS check; propagates through
  `CostCurve`/`FuelCurve` → `ValueCurve` → `FunctionData`. Prefer this over `isa TimeSeriesKey`.
- `get_time_series_key(x)` — returns the underlying `TimeSeriesKey`. Defined for
  `ValueCurve`/`CostCurve` (and `FunctionData`); intentionally **NOT** defined for
  `FuelCurve` — its value curve and `fuel_cost` are independently TS-backed, so resolve
  explicitly via `get_time_series_key(get_value_curve(c))` or `get_fuel_cost(c)`.
  Non-TS-backed curves (and any `FuelCurve`) throw an `ArgumentError`, not a `MethodError`.
- `build_static_curve(owner, curve, start_time)` — resolves a TS curve to its static
  counterpart for one timestep. Issues one storage read per TS-backed field; hot-loop
  consumers should resolve through a `TimeSeriesCache` or batch reads.
- `is_convex`/`is_concave`/`is_valid_data` throw `ArgumentError` for TS-backed curves —
  validate the resolved static curve per timestep instead.

## Auto-Generation

Structs can be auto-generated from JSON descriptors using Mustache templates. Generated files are in `src/generated/` and should **NOT** be edited directly.

- **Descriptor file:** `src/descriptors/structs.json`
- **Generator:** `src/utils/generate_structs.jl`
- **Command:** `julia bin/generate_structs.jl src/descriptors/structs.json src/generated/`

### Workflow

1. Edit the JSON descriptor file to define/modify struct fields
2. Run the generation command
3. Generated files include docstrings and constructors automatically

### needs_conversion codegen contract

When a struct field has `needs_conversion: true` in its JSON descriptor, the code generator
produces two getter variants and one setter:

- `get_X(value, units)` — returns the field value as a bare number in the requested units
  (true only when the owning domain package has registered a `_strip_units` method for the
  returned quantity type).
- `get_X_unitful(value, units)` — returns the field value as a unit-bearing quantity.
- `set_X!(value, val)` — takes **no** `units` argument. The caller must supply a value that
  already carries its own unit tag (a `RelativeQuantity` or domain quantity); `set_value`
  strips it internally. This asymmetry is intentional: getters need to know the target unit
  system (e.g. `SU`, `DU`, `MW`) at call time, while setters rely on the value itself to
  carry unit information.

An `exclude_getter` field means the public getter is hand-written elsewhere; the
generator emits a private `_get_X` for internal use and still exports the base name
`get_X` so the hand-written implementation is public. The `_unitful` companion is
exported ONLY for generated getters (`exclude_getter` absent/false) — it is deliberately
NOT exported for `exclude_getter` fields, since auto-exporting it could break
PowerSystems; coordinate with PSY before widening that export gate.

No descriptor inside IS uses `needs_conversion`; PowerSystems is the first consumer.
The branch is covered by a synthetic-descriptor test in `test/test_generate_structs.jl`.

## Export Policy

IS generally does NOT export functions, to avoid name clashes with downstream packages.
The sanctioned exceptions, all in `src/InfrastructureSystems.jl`:
- the units-interface generics `get_value`/`set_value` — declared in IS, methods
  implemented by domain packages, which must EXTEND (not own/redefine) them; the
  struct-generator template emits methods extending `IS.get_value`/`IS.set_value`;
- the cost aliases (`LinearCurve`, …, and `TimeSeries*` counterparts) — required for
  proper display.

Do not add other exports.

## Known audit items (2026-07-02) — treat as landmines, don't extend

- Supplemental-attribute removal rollback is a **shallow copy** (`supplemental_attribute_manager.jl:~29`) — partial-failure rollback can alias state.
- Component UUID index can desync from the name index (`component.jl` vs `system_data.jl` add/remove paths).
- `bulk_update_cache` can leak when an update errors mid-flight (`time_series_manager.jl:~89,109`).
- **Missing validation descriptor → validation silently passes** (`validation.jl:~74`) — a named silent-failure pattern; new validation code must error loudly instead.
- Containers expose `.data` and ~29 cross-file bare accesses exist — prefer accessor functions; do not add new direct reaches.

## Time Series Type Hierarchy

The whole hierarchy is parameterized on the value element type `T`, so callers dispatch on
the payload instead of querying it:

```
TimeSeriesData{T}
├─ StaticTimeSeries{T} ⊃ SingleTimeSeries{T, N}, NonSequentialTimeSeries{T, N}
└─ Forecast{T} ⊃ Probabilistic{T, N}, Scenarios{T, N},
   └─ AbstractDeterministic{T} ⊃ Deterministic{T, N}, DeterministicSingleTimeSeries{T, N}
```

`DeterministicSingleTimeSeries` is a **fieldless query marker** (as of IS4): the DST is
derived in-store by `transform_single_time_series!`, reads materialize a `Deterministic`,
and no instance is ever constructed. The type exists only for query/removal filters,
`TimeSeriesKey.time_series_type`, and the transform API — do not reintroduce data-bearing
fields or an instance `add_time_series!` path.

### transform_single_time_series! validation lives in Rust

**All** of the transform's eligibility validation is in the InfraStore core — horizon fit
and divisibility, interval divisibility and length, per-resolution grid uniformity, and
conflicts with forecasts already stored. IS used to re-run every one of these in Julia
over a listing of all 100k `SingleTimeSeries`; the store answers them from its distinct
static grids (`GROUP BY resolution`), so the cost is O(distinct resolutions), not
O(series). `_check_transform_single_time_series` and
`_check_single_time_series_transformed_parameters` are **deleted** — do not reintroduce a
Julia-side pre-check.

IS calls through `infrastore_transform_single_time_series!` (`src/infrastore.jl`), which
maps the core's `InvalidParameterError`/`IntegrityError` to `ConflictingInputsError` —
the type callers dispatch on. The returned `TransformOutcome` carries `sources` (0 ⇒ the
"nothing to transform" warning) and `interval_normalized` (⇒ the "only one forecast
window" warning); IS re-emits both warnings from it rather than deriving them.

Three rules turned out **not** to be storage invariants — the core has passing tests
asserting the opposite — so they are opt-in via `TransformPolicy`, which IS sets and
Python/CLI leave at `Default`:

| flag | why it is a client rule |
|---|---|
| `normalize_single_window` | the interval is part of the association identity; IS looks single-window views up by zero, other clients by the horizon |
| `require_uniform_forecast_grid` | the store is happy to hold forecasts on several grids; one-system-one-grid is an IS rule |
| `dry_run` | validate and report without writing — how `check_transform_single_time_series` answers without a trial-and-rollback |

The **irregular-period guard stays in Julia** (`transform_single_time_series!`,
`system_data.jl`): the core supports monthly transforms and has a test for it, so IS's ban
is an IS arithmetic limitation, not a store invariant. It is O(1) and costs nothing.

Now unused inside IS but deliberately kept (downstream may reach them):
`infrastore_list_keys_with_owner` and the 5-arg `get_forecast_window_count`.

`T` is the value element type (`Float64` or a domain type such as `LinearFunctionData`);
`N` is the array rank — per-window for forecasts, per-series for static — and is
deliberately NOT lifted to the abstract parents, since its meaning varies by subtype.

Every concrete type carries a `units::Union{Nothing, String}` field — a **user-declared**
label (`"MW"`), read with `get_units`, defaulting to `nothing`. It is distinct from
`element_type` (package-derived; a user never sets it) and from features (identity):

- set at construction, **immutable** — do not add a setter;
- **never** filterable: not on `TimeSeriesKey`, not a `get_time_series*` argument. Two
  series differing only in their label are a duplicate, and `units` is in the store's
  `RESERVED_FEATURE_NAMES` so it cannot be smuggled in as a feature;
- carried over by every data-sharing constructor (`X(src, name)`, subset forms) and by a
  derived `DeterministicSingleTimeSeries`;
- IS neither interprets nor validates it — no units vocabulary in IS. `nothing` is left
  alone; "unknown" vs "dimensionless" is the caller's convention.

Not to be confused with the `RelativeUnits` system markers (`SU`/`DU`/`NU`) — a per-unit
normalization base, not a physical dimension. Note the accessor-side `units::AbstractUnitSystem`
kwarg documented under "Time series accessors" is **not present on this branch**
(`default_units` in `src/units.jl` has no callers here); when that line merges, the two
`units` spellings will collide by name and the accessor kwarg should be renamed, not this
field. The store column already existed, so no `DATA_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

The same move was made in the Rust core: `units`, `ext`, and `element_type` are now fields
on the five `TimeSeriesData` variants and are **gone from `AddRequest`** — one shape across
IS.jl / InfraStore.jl / infrastore. Set them with the `with_units` / `with_ext` /
`with_element_type` builders on the series (or `set_descriptors` on the enum); the write
path reads them off the data, and `materialize_time_series` fills them back in from the
catalog row on every read. `Store::add_time_series` and `BulkAdd::add` lost their trailing
`units` parameter accordingly.

Bulk and per-key reads agree: `Store::bulk_read` populates the three from the catalog row
it already loads, the bulk-result FFI getters return them (`out_ext` / `out_element_type` /
`out_units`, all nullable), and `InfraStore.jl`'s `_bulk_*` decoders put them on the
reconstructed struct. The long-standing `ext`-drops-on-bulk-read gap is closed as part of
this; there is a parity test in InfraStore.jl's suite — don't reintroduce a read path that
skips them.

**infrasys (Python) is deliberately not done**: its `units` column already holds a
serialized `QuantityMetadata` blob derived from `pint.Quantity`; see
`infrasys/UNITS_FIELD_NOTE.md`.

`Base.eltype(::TimeSeriesData{T}) = T` is the only accessor.
Prefer a signature constraint over a runtime check:

```julia
f(ts::TimeSeriesData{<:PiecewiseStepData}) = ...            # good — dispatch
f(ts::TimeSeriesData) = throw(TypeError(...eltype(ts)))     # explicit mismatch method
```

Because the abstract types are `UnionAll`s, plain `::TimeSeriesData` annotations,
`Type{<:TimeSeriesData}` and `where {T <: TimeSeriesData}` bounds all still work
unchanged. What does NOT work is subtyping without a parameter — `struct Foo <:
TimeSeriesData end` must become `<: TimeSeriesData{Float64}`.

## Time series batching and transactions

One primitive: `time_series_transaction(data) do txn ... end`. The yielded
`TimeSeriesContext` is the block's API surface: call `add_time_series!(txn, owner, ts)` on it
and the adds are buffered and written as one bulk call — that batching is what buys
block-sized array writes and feature-set dedup, which a transaction does not provide. The
block is also an InfraStore transaction: if it throws, everything it did is rolled back,
**including removals**, which are irreversible outside one (the store frees an array once
its last reference goes; inside a transaction that free is deferred to the commit).

`add_time_series!` on the `SystemData` or manager means "no batch": the operation goes
straight to the store, which is atomic on its own. There is no `context` kwarg — the batch
is selected by dispatch on the first argument. A transaction opened on a `SystemData`
carries its owner validation (`owner_validator`); one opened on a bare manager does not.
Read paths take no context and allocate nothing — a `TimeSeriesContext` owns an FFI
`AddBatch` handle, so constructing one per read would be a real cost in per-timestep loops.
The batch itself is created lazily on the first stage. Reads through the manager or system
do not see buffered additions until the transaction block commits. If code must read,
remove, or transform a series staged earlier in the same block, call `flush!(txn)` first;
the write remains transactional but the flush creates a batching boundary.

Constraints: blocks nest innermost-first (SQLite savepoints are a stack), and an open block
holds the store's write lock so gather data *before* opening one.

The batch auto-flushes at `AUTO_FLUSH_THRESHOLD` (10,000) staged additions or
`AUTO_FLUSH_BYTES` (256 MiB) of staged array data, whichever first, so arbitrarily large
blocks hold bounded memory. The count keeps HDF5 chunks near the store's 1 MiB cap (chunk
width = batch width); the byte limit is the real memory bound for long arrays. Auto-flushed
work still rolls back with the block.

Removed in IS4 — do not reintroduce: `begin_time_series_update` (snapshot-diff rollback),
`open_time_series_store!` and its `mode` argument (named an HDF5 handle that no longer
exists; the arg was never read — renamed to `time_series_transaction`),
`bulk_add_time_series!` and `TimeSeriesAssociation` (a six-line loop over the context), and
`ADD_TIME_SERIES_BATCH_SIZE` (silently ignored).

## Core Abstractions

- `InfrastructureSystemsComponent`
- `InfrastructureSystemsType`
- `InfrastructureSystemsContainer`
- `SystemData`
- `TimeSeriesData{T}` (see Time Series Type Hierarchy)
- `ValueCurve` (static and `TimeSeries*` curves)
- `ProductionVariableCostCurve` (`CostCurve{T,U}`, `FuelCurve{T,U}`)
- `FunctionData` (`StaticFunctionData`, `TimeSeriesFunctionData`)
- `RelativeUnits.AbstractUnitSystem` (`DU`, `SU`, `NU` singletons)
- `ComponentSelector`
- `Outputs`

## Testing

- **Location:** `test/`
- **Runner:** ReTest-based — `test/runtests.jl` includes `test/InfrastructureSystemsTests.jl`
  and calls `run_tests()`. Loading the test module also runs Aqua.
- **One-time env setup (REQUIRED**, otherwise tests run against the registry copy of IS):
  `julia --project=test -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(path="."); Pkg.instantiate()'`
- **Single testset** (regex on testset names):
  `julia --project=test -e 'include("test/InfrastructureSystemsTests.jl"); run_tests("<name>")'`
- If the package registry is unreachable (HTTP 403), prefix commands with `JULIA_PKG_SERVER=`.
- Full-suite baseline (2026-07-29): 8,771 passing, 1 broken.
- Requires `INFRASTORE_LIB` pointing at `libinfrastore_ffi` (see the InfraStore repo).

## AI Agent Guidance

Platform-wide practices, performance requirements, and conventions: invoke the `sienna-psy6` skill.

### InfrastructureSystems-Specific Priorities

1. **Auto-generated files** — Never edit files in `src/generated/` directly. Modify `src/descriptors/structs.json` instead and run the generation command.
2. **Performance is critical** — This is a foundational library. Apply performance best practices rigorously in hot paths.
3. **Type stability** — Use `@code_warntype` to verify performance-critical functions.
4. **No `isa`/`<:` branching in function logic** — use multiple dispatch (function barriers for heterogeneous input). Sanctioned exceptions: `serialize`/`deserialize` bodies (cold path, heterogeneous JSON) and exception inspection inside `catch` blocks.
5. **Avoid kwargs as much as possible** — IS is consumed in hot loops; use explicit keyword arguments or none.
6. **Public API documentation** — Add docstrings to all public interface elements using `DocStringExtensions.TYPEDSIGNATURES`.
7. **Formatter** — run it before reporting any task done.
8. **Actionable errors** — Prefer erroring dispatch methods (`ArgumentError` naming the offending types/units) over letting calls fall into Base promotion machinery or bare `MethodError`s.

### When Modifying Code

- Read existing code patterns before making changes
- Maintain consistency with existing style
- Prefer failing fast with clear errors over silent failures
- Consider downstream impact across the whole psy6 stack (see blast radius above)
