"""
Abstract type for time series stored in the system.
Components reference this data through a [`TimeSeriesKey`](@ref); the data itself is held
by the `InfraStore` backend so it can reside on storage media instead of memory.

`T` is the value element type (`Float64` or a domain type such as `LinearFunctionData`).
Because it is a parameter of the abstract type, callers can dispatch on the payload type
directly — `f(ts::TimeSeriesData{<:PiecewiseStepData})` — rather than querying it and
branching on `<:`.

Return the user-declared units label of a time series (e.g. `"MW"`), or `nothing` when it
carries none.

IS neither interprets nor validates the label: there is no units vocabulary in IS, and
`nothing` may mean either "unknown" or "dimensionless" — that is the caller's convention
to establish.

This label, [`get_quantity_kind`](@ref), and [`get_unit_system`](@ref) share one contract.
All three are set at construction and are immutable — there is deliberately no setter.
They describe the values, so every constructor that shares another instance's data carries
all three over. And none of them is part of a time series' identity: they never appear in a
[`TimeSeriesKey`](@ref), never filter a query, and are never arguments to
`get_time_series`. Two series that differ only in these labels are the same series, and
adding both is a duplicate.

Not to be confused with [`get_unit_system`](@ref), which names the per-unit normalization
base the values are already expressed in rather than naming a physical dimension. The two
are independent: a series labeled `"MW"` may still be read against any normalization base.
"""
get_units(value::TimeSeriesData) = value.units

"""
Return the kind of physical quantity a time series measures (e.g. `"ActivePower"`), or
`nothing` when it declares none.

This sits *above* [`get_units`](@ref) rather than duplicating it. A units library's
dimensional analysis cannot separate active from reactive power — both are `[M L^2 T^-3]` —
but a quantity kind can. And when [`get_unit_system`](@ref) is a per-unit base the values
are dimensionless, so this is the only surviving record of what they measure.

IS neither interprets nor validates the string; the recommended vocabulary is a
[QUDT](https://www.qudt.org/pages/QUDToverviewPage.html) `QuantityKind` local name. See
[`get_units`](@ref) for the immutability and identity contract the three labels share.
"""
get_quantity_kind(value::TimeSeriesData) = value.quantity_kind

"""
Return the unit system a time series' values are **already expressed in** — one of the
[`RelativeUnits`](@ref) markers `NU` (natural units), `CU` (component base), or `SU` (system
base) — or `nothing` when the series declares none.

Note the direction: `SU`/`CU`/`NU` are used elsewhere in IS as a *target* to convert
**to**, whereas here the marker records the basis the stored values are **in**. It is a
declaration, not a conversion: IS rescales nothing on the strength of it, and converting
per-unit values back to natural units needs the base that lives on the owning component
(see [`get_base_value`](@ref)).

`nothing` means *unspecified*, which is deliberately not the same as `NU`: a series that
never declared a basis must not be read as though someone had said its values were natural.

See [`get_units`](@ref) for the immutability and identity contract the three labels share.

!!! note

    The backing store represents only `NU` and `CU`. A series declaring `SU` is rejected
    when it is added — see [`get_time_series`](@ref) and the store adapter — rather than
    being silently downgraded.
