# base powers, which belong to the domain package that owns components.

# rates (\$/h, MBTU/h) that carry no power units — which is what
# `y_axis_power_dimension == Val(0)` records, and why `_convert_value_curve` reduces to a
# bare `scale_x` here. (A `LossCurve`, whose y-axis is power, picks up the y-scaling.)
# Note that `scale_x` still changes the stored y *data* of an
# `IncrementalCurve`/`AverageRateCurve` — those y-axes are rates per unit of x (\$/MWh),
# so x's units sit in the denominator and must convert with it. That factor is the chain
# rule inside `scale_x`, not a y-scaling of the curve.

`U` parameter is `typeof(to)`.

`ratio` is the x-axis ratio between the two bases: `x_from = ratio * x_to`. It is passed
in rather than derived here because `InfrastructureSystems` has no notion of a component
or a base power to derive it from — the base arithmetic belongs to the domain package that
owns the bases (in the Sienna stack, `PowerSystems`, which resolves it per component and
physical category and provides the component-aware accessors on top of this).
