# View Draft Documentation on Github

 1. Create a pull request on Github.

 2. Verify the Documentation/build check was successful (takes a few minutes).
 3. Preview it in a browser following this url format:
    
    > https://nrel-sienna.github.io/<PACKAGE\_NAME>.jl/previews/PR<PULL\_REQUEST\_NUMBER>/

*This only works if the PR is on the root repository, not a fork.* Otherwise, work with a
maintainer to move your PR to the root repository.
