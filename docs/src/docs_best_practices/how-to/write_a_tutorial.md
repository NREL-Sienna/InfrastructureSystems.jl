# Write a Tutorial

Tutorials are learning experiences to give our users confidence and experience in using
Sienna.

## Prepare

  - If you have not read [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/), first read it in its entirety.
  - If you have read it, skim the pages on [Tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) and
    the [difference between a tutorial and how-to guide](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/)
    to refresh your memory and refer back throughout the process.
  - Look at an example: `PowerSystems.jl`'s
    [Working with Time Series](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/tutorials/working_with_time_series/)

!!! warning
    
    Historically, many of Sienna's "tutorials" have blended all 4 types of documentation in
    the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework. If you are editing, be prepared to move
    material to related Explanation and How-to pages and into function docstrings in the APIs
    as you work.
    
    If you starting a new tutorial, ask yourself if a tutorial is appropriate for what
    you're trying to show, or if you should be writing a how-to instead.
    See also how to [Write a How-to Guide](@ref).

## Follow the Do's and Don't's

The [Diataxis Tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) page should be your main reference
as you write, but in addition, use these functional and aesthetic guidelines to
ensure we follow Diataxis and avoid common pitfalls from previous versions of Sienna
documentation:

```@contents
Pages = ["write_a_tutorial.md"]
Depth = 3:3
```

### Make it reproducible

A user should be able to run the code in the tutorial from start to finish and get the exact
results seen on the documentation page. Provide multiple file formats for users for ease of
use: Jupyter Notebooks, Julia scripts, and the documentation Markdown with copy/pastable
code blocks.

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Unlike other documentation categories (e.g., How-To's), write tutorials as a .jl script
    in [`Literate.jl`](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/stable/) format to
    enable the auto-generation of a Jupyter Notebook that users can run directly.
    
    Most Sienna repos contain functionality in the `make.jl` and `make_tutorials.jl` files
    to automate Notebook generation from .jl scripts in the docs/src/tutorials/ folder. See
    [`SiennaTemplate.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/SiennaTemplate.jltree/main/docs)
    for the code.

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Display all code, starting from `using SomeSiennaPackage`. Example: See
    [Working with Time Series](@extref tutorial_time_series).

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Use `#hide` or
    [`@setup`](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/syntax/#reference-at-setup)
    blocks.

### Give it a story

The tutorial should have a logical flow, rather than be a series of disconnected code
demonstrations.

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Using the [`Literate.jl`](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/stable/) script format (above),
    all code blocks will render in the resulting markdown as named
    [`@example`](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/syntax/#reference-at-example) blocks,
    ensuring all code compiles in order in the same environment and that each step builds
    on the previous steps in your story:
    
    ````markdown
    ```@example my_tutorial
    <Some code here>
    ```
    ````

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Write markdown with a series of `julia` markdown blocks. These won't be compiled, failing the
    intention of a tutorial and introducing high likelihood of errors as syntax changes.
    
    ````markdown
    ```julia
    <Some code here>
    ```
    ````

### Make it effortless to read

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Split code examples into ideally 1 (to 3) lines ONLY, with a short preface
    to explain what each line is doing, even if it's obvious to you.

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Use blocks of example code and/or return statements that go over 1 screen
    length in the compiled .html. They are very hard to follow and allow a user to tune out
    or give up.

### Make it realistic and relatable

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Take the time to define some realistic example data.

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Use `zero()` or `one()` for all example data.

### Only show relevant log and return statements

!!! tip "Do"
    
    [Configure the logger](@ref log) or load/build a `System` that returns very
    few log statements. Use semi-colons at line ends to hide return statements if need be.

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Show extensive or confusing log or return statements that bog down a reader with
    information that isn't directly relevant to what you're trying to teach.

### Remove other types of documentation

Particularly when editing existing material, watch out for material that should be
moved elsewhere according to Diataxis principles:

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Preface each call to a new function with a hyperlink to that function's
    docstring so the user can find more detail

!!! warning "Don't"
    
    Include definitions and details about different keyword arguments or versions of
    a function in the tutorial itself. Some basic information is OK, but details and
    examples live in the docstrings, and they especially shouldn't be included in the
    tutorial **in lieu of** being in the docstrings.

### Follow the Guidelines on Cleaning Up General Formatting

!!! tip "Do"
    
    Follow How-to [Clean Up General Formatting](@ref).

### Look at the compiled .html!

!!! tip "Do"
    
      - [Compile](@ref "Compile and View Documentation Locally") the tutorial regularly and
        look at it
      - Check all code examples gave the expected results without erroring
      - Check for length of the code examples and iteratively adjust to make it easy
        to read
