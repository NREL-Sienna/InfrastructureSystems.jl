# Time Series Data

`InfrastructureSystems.jl` implements containers and routines to efficiently manage time
series data. This document contains content for developers of new time series data. For the
usage please refer to the documentation in [PowerSystems.jl](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable).

Time series storage is backed by **InfraStore**, accessed through its `InfraStore.jl` binding.
InfraStore manages both the time series data and the associations between components /
supplemental attributes and that data. Reasons to consider using it:

  - Numerical arrays are stored independently of components in an HDF5 file with a SQLite
    catalog; components store associations to that data rather than copies.
  - System memory is not depleted by loading all time series data at once. Only data that you
    need is loaded.
  - Storage is **content-addressed**: identical arrays are de-duplicated automatically by their
    SHA-256 hash, so multiple components or supplemental attributes that share the same data
    cost a single array on disk.
  - Supports serialization and deserialization.

## On-disk artifact

A persisted store is **two files that form one logical artifact** and must be moved, copied,
and deleted together:

  - `<path>.h5` — an HDF5 file holding the numerical arrays.
  - `<path>.sqlite` — a SQLite catalog of time series *associations* (metadata).

> **`deepcopy` does not duplicate the on-disk `.h5`/`.sqlite` files.** A `deepcopy` of a
> system yields a new object that still references the same files on disk. To obtain an
> independent copy, serialize and then deserialize the system.

*Notes*:

  - Time series data can optionally be stored fully in memory. Refer to the
    [`InfrastructureSystems.SystemData`](@ref) documentation (`time_series_in_memory`).
  - On-disk artifacts are created on the tmp filesystem by default, using the location obtained
    from `tempdir()`. This can be changed via `time_series_directory` if the data is larger than
    the available tmp space. Refer to the [`InfrastructureSystems.SystemData`](@ref) link above.
  - By default, the call to `add_time_series!` writes per call, which has overhead. If you will
    add thousands of time series arrays, batch them with `time_series_transaction`: call
    `add_time_series!` on the yielded transaction and they are written as one bulk call.
    The block is also a transaction — if it throws, everything it did is rolled back,
    **including removals**, which are irreversible outside one. Hold the block only for the
    writes; gather the data first, since an open block holds the store's write lock.

## Instructions

 1. Ensure that `supports_time_series(::MyComponent)` returns true for the struct. It may
    be implemented on a supertype of the struct.

## Data Format

Numerical arrays live in the HDF5 file, keyed by the SHA-256 hash of their contents
(content addressing, which yields automatic de-duplication). The SQLite catalog records one
row per **association** between an owner (component or supplemental attribute) and a stored
array, identified by:

  - `owner_id` and `owner_category` (component or supplemental attribute)
  - `name`
  - `resolution`
  - `features` (user-defined tags)
  - `time_series_type` (`SingleTimeSeries`, `Deterministic`, `Probabilistic`, `Scenarios`, or
    `DeterministicSingleTimeSeries`)

together with the forecast window parameters (`initial_timestamp`, `horizon`, `interval`,
`count`) and the array's content hash. A `DeterministicSingleTimeSeries` shares the underlying
`SingleTimeSeries` array and synthesizes its forecast windows on read.

### The `units` label

Every time series type carries an optional `units` label — a user-declared string such as
`"MW"`, read back with `get_units`:

```julia
ts = SingleTimeSeries("load", initial_timestamp, resolution, values; units = "MW")
get_units(get_time_series(SingleTimeSeries, component, "load"))  # "MW"
```

It is deliberately *not* like `features`. Features are identity: they are part of the key
and they filter a query. The label is a description of the values, so:

  - it is set at construction and is **immutable** — there is no setter;
  - it is **never** an argument to `get_time_series`, never filters, and never appears on a
    `TimeSeriesKey`. Two series differing only in their label are the same series, and
    adding both is a duplicate;
  - it is carried over by constructors that share another instance's data, and by a derived
    `DeterministicSingleTimeSeries`;
  - it defaults to `nothing`, which IS never fills in — whether that means "unknown" or
    "dimensionless" is the caller's convention.

IS neither interprets nor validates it: there is no units vocabulary in IS, so a consumer
that converts values on read owns both the vocabulary and the conversion. Do not confuse it
with the unit *system* concept in `RelativeUnits` (`SU`/`CU`/`NU`), which selects a per-unit
normalization base rather than naming a physical dimension. The two are independent: a
series labeled `"MW"` may still be read against any normalization base.

For the authoritative on-disk format — HDF5 dataset layout, hashing, the SQLite schema, and
the `DATA_FORMAT_VERSION` compatibility contract — see the `InfraStore` repository's
file-format reference.

## Identifying and retrieving a time series

The surface splits in two. **Identify** with
[`InfrastructureSystems.list_time_series_metadata`](@ref), which returns a
[`InfrastructureSystems.TimeSeriesMetadata`](@ref) row per matching association — `name`,
`resolution`, `features`, `initial_timestamp`, and for a forecast `horizon`, `interval` and
`count`. **Act** with the row's
[`InfrastructureSystems.TimeSeriesKey`](@ref), which is the association's store-minted
`association_id` and nothing else:

```julia
rows = list_time_series_metadata(owner)  # enumerate; each row carries its attributes
get_name(rows[1])                        # a column of the row, read from the catalog
ts = get_time_series(owner, rows[1])     # a row is accepted anywhere a key is
key = get_time_series_key(rows[1])       # store this in your own model
```

A key carries only the id because everything else is a copy of something the catalog already
holds, and a copy can only disagree with it: `rename_time_series!` and a reassignment both
change catalog columns while preserving the id. Take the attributes from a row, whose age you
know, rather than from a handle you may have held for a while.

A key serializes to its `association_id`, its time series kind, and its value element type —
all three facts the store never rewrites — so it rebuilds itself without the catalog that
minted it. Nothing has to be scoped around a deserialization that may meet one.

The store mints that id as it inserts the row, which is why a key exists only once the
addition has been written. A direct `add_time_series!(sys, owner, ts)` writes on the spot and
returns the key. An addition staged into a `time_series_transaction` is still buffered, so it
has no id yet and the call returns `nothing`; open the block with `collect_keys = true` and
read `added_keys(txn)` once it has flushed:

```julia
key = time_series_transaction(sys; collect_keys = true) do txn
    add_time_series!(txn, component, ts)
    flush!(txn)
    only(added_keys(txn))
end
```

## Debugging

Inspect a persisted (closed) store with standard HDF5 and SQLite tools. For example,
`h5ls -r <path>.h5` shows the dataset layout and shapes, and `sqlite3 <path>.sqlite` lets you
query the association catalog directly. Do not open a *live* store's `.h5` file with HDF5.jl —
InfraStore statically links its own pinned libhdf5 and holds the file open; go through the
store's API instead.

## Maintenance

HDF5 files cannot shrink in place. Deleting time series drops the arrays, but the `.h5` file
stays the same size — and this holds for `clear_time_series!` too, which empties the store
without shrinking its file. Small arrays share packed datasets, so their slots are reused by
later additions; the space held by a large standalone array is not returned.

Serializing and deserializing does not repack the artifact either: an on-disk store is
persisted by copying its two files byte-for-byte.

`compact_time_series!(data)` is the operation that does reclaim it. For a system whose time series live
on disk, it rewrites the `.h5` from what the catalog still references and swaps the rewrite
over the original, so the file finally shrinks; the system stays usable across the swap. It
returns an `InfraStore.CompactionReport`, whose `bytes_reclaimed` says how much came back:

```julia
report = IS.compact_time_series!(data)
@show report.bytes_reclaimed
```

Two caveats. The rewrite assumes this process is the artifact's only user — another process
with it open keeps reading the pre-compaction file on Unix, and blocks the replacement on
Windows. And a system holding its time series in memory has no file to rewrite, so it
reports `0` bytes; there, building a fresh `SystemData` with only the data worth keeping is
still the way to shed the arrays.
